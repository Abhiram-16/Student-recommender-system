# Student Recommender System 🎓

An intelligent course recommendation system that predicts the most suitable elective subjects for students based on their academic performance and interests.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project uses machine learning and basic NLP to analyze a student's academic history and recommend electives for upcoming semesters. It supports:
- Semester 3-2 recommendations
- Semester 4-1 recommendations
- Course pools for personalized selection
- Optional interest-based input using NLP (extendable)

Built using **Flask**, **scikit-learn**, and **pandas**, the system provides a web interface for students to input their marks and get recommendations.

## 🚀 How It Works

- **Step 1**: Student logs in / registers
- **Step 2**: Enters subject marks (core subjects)
- **Step 3**: ML model predicts scores for elective subjects
- **Step 4**: Highest-scoring electives from each pool are recommended

Machine Learning Models:
- Trained on structured academic data
- Use `RandomForestRegressor` to predict subject performance

future scope:
- NLP model matches student's free-text interests with course descriptions
